# Passpartu

Passpartu makes policies great again (works awesome with Pundit).

Instead of this:
```ruby
class PostPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def update?
    user.super_admin? || user.admin? || user.manager? || user.supervisor?
  end
end
```

just this:
```ruby
class PostPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def update?
    user.can?(:post, :update)
  end
end
```
## Usage
Include `Passpartu` into your policy model.
```ruby
class User
  include Passpartu
end
```
NOTE: Your `User` model must respond to `role` method that returns a string or a symbol!

Keep all your policies in one place.
Create `./config/passpartu.yml` and start writing your policies.

#### Example
```yml
# ./config/passpartu.yml

admin:
  post:
    create: false
    update: true
    delete: true 
  order:
    create: true
    edit: true
    delete: true
  product:
    create: false
    edit: true
    delete: true
  items:  
    crud: true
    delete: false
manager:
  order:
    create: true
    edit: true
    delete: false
  product:
    create: true
    edit: true
    delete: false

```
#### Crud
It's possible to use `crud` key to set values for `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete` at once.
`create`, `read`, `update`, `delete` has higher priority than `crud`
In case `crud: true` and `delete: false` - result `false` 


#### Except
It's possible to exclude role from checks
```ruby
    user_admin.can?(:orders, :edit) # check policy for admin and returns true if policy true
    user_admin.can?(:orders, :edit, except: :admin) # returns false because user is admin and we excluded admin
    
```
It's possible to give an array as except attribute

```ruby
  user_admin.can?(:orders, :edit, except: [:admin, :manager]) # returns false
  user_manager.can?(:orders, :edit, except: [:admin, :manager]) # returns false
```
## Configuration

You can configure Passpartu by creating `./config/initializers/passpartu.rb`.

#### Default configs are:

```ruby
Passpartu.configure do |config|
  config.policy_file = './config/passpartu.yml'
  config.raise_policy_missed_error = true
end
```
### Raise policy missed errors
By default Passpartu will raise an PolicyMissedError if policy is missed in `passpartu.yml`. In initializer set  `config.raise_policy_missed_error = false` in order to return `false` in case when policy is not defined. This is a good approach to write only "positive" policies (only true) and automatically restricts everything that is not mentioned in `passpartu.yml`

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'passpartu'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install passpartu
